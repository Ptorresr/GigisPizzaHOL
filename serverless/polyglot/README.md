# There is more to life than Java!

*OCI Functions* can be written in any language that executes in a Docker
container.

As well as Java, Function Development Kits (FDKs) are available for:
- Ruby
- Python
- Node.js
- Go
- .Net Core

(please feel free to contribute a new FDK to the Fn Project ;-) )

Polyglot alternatives to some of the Java functions in the HOL may be found here.
